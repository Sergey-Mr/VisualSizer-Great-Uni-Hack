* OpenCV 4.6.0-dev
* OpenPose v1.7.0
* Cuda 11.7.r11.7
* PyTorch 1.13.1+cu117
* YOLO v5

## Repository explanation
4 main code are used in the body measurement process
1) main_working_2.py to find length of hands, shoulders, run openpose, analyze points of body
2) roi-find.py uses yolo to find a human and restrict ROI
3) jsond_data_out.py to get points after openpose and put them into main_working_2.py
4) pytorch_working_01.py to get a mask of the body (white-black)
